# ExploitFixer

ExploitFixer is a high performance packet filter that prevents many kinds of crashers, laggers and exploits from being used in your Spigot/Paper server.

You can download the prebuilt jar file from [here](https://github.com/Obydux/ExploitFixer/releases/tag/release).

## Hosting

I highly recommend BisectHosting for your server needs. They have 20 server locations, advanced DDoS protection and an user-friendly panel for server management. Use promo code **OBYDUX** to get 25% off!
